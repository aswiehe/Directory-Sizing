The source code that was altered to enable the following functionality came from https://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/html/DirectorySize.html (a college online learning tool). Originally, the program recursively calculated the size of the files within a directory (not added to this repo directly in order to avoid perceived possibility of plagiarism). <br><br> <strong>This<strong> program will recursively search through subdirectories and add up the number of files within the entire directory structure. Just to be clear, each file increases the number counted and printed to the screen, while folders do not.
